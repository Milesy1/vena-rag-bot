# Vena vs. Pigment: Comparing Features, Integrations, Reviews and More
Finance leaders evaluating both Vena and Pigment for their corporate performance management needs find themselves comparing two platforms built with very different philosophies.
Both promise connected, real-time planning—but how they deliver on that promise couldn’t be more distinct.
Pigment is a relatively young player in the FP&A software market, known for its sleek interface and flexibility. It appeals to teams that want to build customized models from the ground up and are willing to invest time and resources to do it.
However, that flexibility comes with trade-offs: a steep learning curve, limited out-of-the-box functionality and reliance on proprietary formulas that require technical fluency to manage.
Vena, on the other hand, combines the power of a centralized database with the familiarity of Excel—its native interface. With 20+ pre-configured solutions across industries and use cases, built-in financial consolidation capabilities and a visual workflow designer, Vena helps FP&A teams streamline everything from planning and reporting to financial close and reconciliation.
In this article, we’ll break down how Vena and Pigment differ in ease of use, integrations, and functionality, based on analyst insights and real-user reviews.
The goal isn’t to crown a winner—it’s to give you a clear picture of which tool aligns better with your organization’s structure, processes and expectations for time-to-value.

## Vena: Pros and Cons
Vena’s strength lies in its ability to combine the flexibility of Excel with the power of a centralized, cloud-based database. For finance teams that already live in spreadsheets, that familiarity translates into faster adoption and less time spent learning new tools or rebuilding existing processes.
Unlike the majority of CPM platforms that require you to learn proprietary formula languages or new modeling structures, Vena lets users build on what they already know—Excel—while still enforcing governance, version control and real-time collaboration.
Its suite of 20+ pre-configured solutions across industries and use cases (from industries like manufacturing and banking, to use cases like workforce planning and financial consolidation) means organizations can get up and running quickly without having to design models from scratch, using templates built on deep expertise of your industry’s needs.
The platform’s integration with Microsoft 365 and Azure adds another layer of strength—giving users direct connections to Excel, Power BI, PowerPoint and Teams, and enabling AI-powered insights through Vena Copilot and Vena Insights.
“Vena does a great job at organizing your data into a simple database format. Your data can be complex, but with Vena, it's easy to draw it down and organize it into ways that make sense. FP&A is now easier, and our processes sped up.” — Andrew M., Senior Financial Analyst, G2 user

## Pigment: Pros and Cons
Pigment is designed for flexibility. Its multidimensional modeling engine and visual dashboards make it attractive to teams that want to experiment with structure and design—especially those accustomed to building from scratch.
Larger enterprises with dedicated technical teams and complex data hierarchies may find this customization appealing, particularly if they’re already standardized on Google Workspace.
However, the trade-offs are clear. Pigment’s proprietary syntax and formulas mean users must invest significant time in learning the system before they can use it effectively. Most financial models need to be built manually, since Pigment’s templated applications offer frameworks rather than complete, logic-based solutions.
The absence of built-in financial consolidation features, limited workflow automation and a small ecosystem of implementation partners can make it challenging for organizations to achieve fast time-to-value.
### Pigment Pros
Highly customizable modeling environment
Modern UI and visual dashboards
Strong alignment with Google Cloud ecosystem
Flexible permissions and access controls

In short, Pigment gives teams freedom to customize every element of their FP&A setup—but at the cost of time, complexity and internal resources.
## Integrations and Ecosystem Fit
### Vena’s Integration Depth
Vena supports integrations with key source systems, including ERP/GL, HRIS, CRM and data lakes and warehouses.
Key highlights include:
Pre-built connectors and out-of-the-box data connections: finance teams can pull in actuals, operational metrics and headcount data without extensive development.
Vena also offers six new Microsoft Fabric data integrations (Microsoft Dynamics 365 F&O, Acumatica, Xero, Deltek VantagePoint, SAP S/4HANA and OneLake), allowing teams to unify data from multiple sources into a consistent, governed analytics layer. This reduces data fragmentation and streamlines planning and reporting across systems.
Native Microsoft ecosystem alignment: Vena integrates seamlessly with Microsft Excel, Power BI, PowerPoint, Teams and Azure, allowing teams to stay in familiar tools while gaining enterprise-grade planning capabilities.
A layered offering of integration approaches: pre-built connectors, bidirectional Rest APIs, and flat-file automation (i.e. Microsoft Power Automate, Vena ETL) for legacy or bespoke systems. This means teams can integrate new and old data sources without restructuring their architecture.

This combination enables faster time-to-value, since teams don’t need to wait for an infrastructure overhaul before their FP&A platform begins to deliver.
### Pigment: Flexibility With Some Setup Overhead
Pigment offers a modern integration portfolio that appeals to teams looking for flexibility—especially in hybrid or cloud-native environments. Their website lists connectors for ERP/Accounting (SAP, NetSuite, Sage Intacct), CRM, HRIS, spreadsheets, data lakes and custom APIs.
Pigment has broad support for systems including Snowflake, BigQuery, Azure SQL, Google Cloud Storage and traditional ERPs.
However, full connector access and advanced integration capabilities appear to be tied to higher pricing tiers or “on the product development roadmap” status.

However, full connector access and advanced integration capabilities appear to be tied to higher pricing tiers or “on the product development roadmap” status.
For organizations already invested in the Google Cloud stack or comfortable with building custom integrations, Pigment offers a flexible blueprint—but it requires more time and IT involvement to go live.
“It’s not that stable, needs some improvements in the stability of the product. Crashes sometimes. There is a learning curve for the script because pigment has its own logic.” — Mayuri Jadhav, System Engineer, TrustRadius user
### What’s the Right Fit for Your Tech Stack and Timeline?
Integration strategy isn’t set-it-and-forget-it—it’s about ensuring your data connections are set up to require minimal maintenance headaches and IT requests.
Finance leaders should consider:
Are you a Microsoft-centric organization? If Excel, Power BI, PowerPoint and Azure form your business’s backbone, Vena’s strategic integration with the Microsoft ecosystem means fewer silos, less training overhead and quicker adoption.
Are you a Google-centric organization? If your analytics and collaboration tools are based in Google Workspace, Pigment’s alignment may make the most sense. But plan for additional build and governance effort.
Are you under pressure to deliver value? If your FP&A team needs to ramp quickly, Vena’s pre-built connections and familiar interface reduce risk. Pigment’s flexibility comes at the cost of longer build time and potentially higher ongoing maintenance.

## How the Technology Works
### Vena’s Native Excel Experience
Vena is built on the premise that finance teams work best when they aren’t forced to abandon the tools and logic structures they already trust. Instead of requiring you to learn a new modeling language or interface, Vena brings a centralized, governed data engine directly into Excel.
This means users can build, adjust and extend planning models using standard Excel formulas—without exporting, copying or manually stitching spreadsheets together.
Data flows from your source systems (ERP, CRM, HRIS, data warehouse) into Vena CubeFLEXTM (Vena’s centralized database), and then appears back in Excel in real time.
Because the data layer is structured, auditable, and governed, finance leaders can maintain version control and ensure data quality, while still giving FP&A analysts the flexibility to explore scenarios, run comparisons or build ad hoc models.
This architectural choice also strengthens operational continuity.
Most FP&A and accounting teams already have existing templates for revenue forecasting, headcount planning, variance analysis, financial close/consolidation and board reporting. Vena allows you to retain and enhance those templates and data, through the Vena platform rather than rebuild, significantly speeding up your time to value and reducing the burden of change management.
Starting with the least complicated use case, then, can earn you a win quickly and with little difficulty. Capstone Infrastructure took this approach with their financial close use case, using Vena’s native Excel interface, and collaborative workflows to standardize month-end reporting and financial close, after which they expanded into reforecasting, creating a more strategic, data-driven role for the office of finance overall.
“Having the business plan, automatic actual data and then reforecasting capabilities—all in one template with reliable GL data—has significantly expanded our use case. More and more operational data is starting to migrate into Vena,” said Devendra Kalwani, Associate, Vice President, Capstone Infrastructure Corp.
The result is a planning environment that encourages adoption, accelerates onboarding and preserves institutional knowledge—without sacrificing governance, auditability or scalability.
### Pigment’s Proprietary Modeling Language
Pigment takes a different approach. Instead of grounding the platform in Excel, it introduces its own modeling language. Users build models using Pigment’s proprietary syntax, logic functions and data structures.
This offers a high degree of flexibility: organizations can design highly custom planning environments tailored to their operational model, revenue structure or reporting hierarchies. This approach can be powerful, particularly for enterprises that want to rethink their end-to-end planning processes.
However, this flexibility comes with a learning curve. To work effectively in Pigment, users must understand its terminology, logic patterns and formula structure—skills that don’t directly translate from deep experience working in Excel. Even experienced analysts can find themselves spending considerable time retraining or recreating templates that once lived in spreadsheets.
Because models are primarily custom-built, scalability depends on your organization’s internal capacity to maintain and extend them. Complex forecasting logic, consolidation structures or workflow rules must be architected from scratch. Over time, this can increase operational overhead, particularly during personnel changes or as the organization grows.
### Choosing an Approach That Fits Your Team
The underlying technologies we’ve just explained reflect two fundamentally different philosophies.
Vena assumes that Excel is the system of execution for Finance and Accounting—and enhances it with governance, auditability and scalability. Research from AFP shows that 85% of FP&A professionals use spreadsheets alongside their enterprise performance management systems.
Pigment assumes that the planning environment should be redesigned—and expects teams to learn and maintain a new modeling standard.

Finance leaders deciding between Vena and Pigment should consider not only functional capabilities, but the reality of how their teams work, how quickly they need to deploy and how much ongoing maintenance of the platform they can sustain.
## What Real Users Are Saying

## Which FP&A Platform Is Right for You: A Question of Philosophy
When teams evaluate planning platforms, the focus is often on the first implementation. But the real test comes later, across multiple planning cycles, when targets shift, business models evolve, and more people get involved in forecasting and reporting.
The right platform is the one that continues to scale with your business, remains easy for your broader team to use, and supports planning in a way that compounds—not resets—your operational knowledge over time.
With Vena, expansion tends to follow a predictable pattern: new templates, new workflows, new data sources and built on a structure that stays stable. The familiar modeling layer means knowledge compounds over time.
With Pigment, expansion depends heavily on the continuity of internal modeling expertise. If the person or team who built the original structure moves on, the organization must rebuild institutional knowledge inside the platform.
For some teams, that’s a worthwhile tradeoff for design freedom. For others, it creates a risk of depending on a single person, which could cause the entire project to crumble.
So the decision isn’t primarily about features. It’s about which planning culture you're choosing to scale:
Vena supports continuity and adoption by building on skills your team already has, while adding structure, governance and collaboration layers that grow with you.
Pigment offers a more open, build-from-scratch environment, where teams design new planning structures and workflows—ideal if you have the time and resources to redefine how planning is done.
