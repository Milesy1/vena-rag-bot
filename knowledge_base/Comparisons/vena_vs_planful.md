Request DemoTake a Tour## Why Finance Teams Choose Vena Over Planful
### Stay in Native Excel
Vena is fully native to Excel for flexibility and fast adoption. Planful uses plug-ins and a proprietary grid that limits functionality and adds complexity.

### Plan in One Unified Platform
Vena runs all planning on one centralized model. Planful splits workflows across Structured and Dynamic Planning, leading to duplicated maintenance and disconnected reporting.

### Keep Data Connections Simple and Dependable
Vena connects directly to source systems and Microsoft Fabric, avoiding middleware. Planful depends on Boomi, increasing breakage risk and integration upkeep.

## How Do I Know if Vena Is Right for My Team?
### Flexible Modeling That Finance Teams Can Own
Vena combines native Excel with a centralized planning engine, letting finance teams build, update and extend models without consultants. Unlike Planful’s split modules, Vena supports faster scenario changes, simpler maintenance and greater day-to-day ownership.

## Collaboration and Workflow Tools Built for Modern FP&A
Vena’s visual workflow builder makes it easy to manage tasks, approvals and deadlines across teams in one place. Planful’s flatter, module-based workflows make it harder to coordinate contributors and track accountability end to end.

## Workforce Planning That Scales With Your Organization
Vena unifies headcount, compensation and finance data so teams can model workforce changes quickly. Planful’s workforce planning often relies on manual steps and lacks the granularity fast-growing organizations need.

## Frequently Asked Questions
#### How Is Vena’s Platform Architecture Different from Planful’s
Vena is built as a single, unified FP&A platform with a centralized data model and a native Excel interface. Planning, reporting and analysis all run on the same architecture, so users don’t need to move between modules or learn new grids or formula languages.

Planful’s architecture separates Structured Planning and Dynamic Planning and relies on proprietary spreadsheet interfaces and add-ins to interact with the platform. This modular approach can increase complexity, require more administration and make it harder for users to work seamlessly across planning and reporting.

#### How Long Does It Take To Implement Vena?
Vena implementation timelines vary based on data complexity, use cases and team size, but many FP&A teams see value in as little as 6–8 weeks. Vena’s services team helps design your planning models, integrate source systems and train users, so adoption is fast and sustainable. The platform is built to scale over time without requiring reimplementation as needs evolve.

Planful markets quick time-to-value as well, but its multi-module architecture, third-party middleware and heavier reliance on consultants for configuration and template changes can add complexity—especially as your requirements expand.

#### What Systems Does Vena Integrate With?
Vena integrates with leading ERP, CRM, HRIS and operational systems through native connectors, APIs and Microsoft Fabric pipelines. Common integrations include Microsoft Dynamics 365, NetSuite, SAP, Sage Intacct, Salesforce, Workday and ADP. These direct integrations reduce reliance on middleware, helping ensure accurate, governed data for planning, reporting and analysis.

#### How Much Does Vena Cost?
Vena’s pricing is customized based on your organization’s size, users, use cases and support requirements. Packages range from core FP&A capabilities to advanced analytics, AI and premium services. Customers consistently rate Vena highly for price-to-value due to its flexibility, scalability, and lower long-term ownership costs.

In BARC’s 2025 Planning Survey, users rated Vena 9.6 out of 10 in the price to value category.

Planful’s pricing is not publicly available.

#### Vena or Planful: Which Is Best for Your Team?
Vena and Planful are both established CPM platforms designed for mid-market and enterprise finance teams. Vena stands out for its native Excel interface, unified planning platform and Microsoft-first integrations, making it easier for teams to model, forecast and report without added complexity. Planful offers broad functionality, but organizations that prioritize flexibility, Excel-based workflows and scalable planning often find Vena to be the better long-term fit.
