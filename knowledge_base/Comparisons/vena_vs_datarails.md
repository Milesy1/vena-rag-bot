Request Demo## Why Finance Teams Choose Vena Over Datarails
### Get Full Excel—Not Just a Plug-in
Vena works natively in Excel so you can use the full interface and functionality. Datarails relies on a plug-in, limiting features and complicating data management.

### Built To Scale With Your Business
Vena supports use cases beyond FP&A—like workforce planning and financial close—so you can consolidate processes and gain efficiencies on one platform.

### Easy To Use and Maintain
Vena auto-populates Excel with source data, keeping your workflow intact. Datarails forces you to toggle between apps, making Excel use cumbersome.

## How Do I Know if Vena Is Right for My Team?
### Powerful Multi-Dimensional Modeling With Vena CubeFLEXTM
Vena’s in-memory OLAP database is optimized for multi-dimensional analysis of large volumes of financial and operational data. Datarails, on the other hand, uses relational database technology, which leads to performance constraints when handling complex queries.

## Go Live With Best-in-Class Implementation Support
We’re hands-on with every Vena implementation. Our services team works closely with you to ensure a smooth rollout and confident adoption. Datarails, however, leaves most of the implementation work to the user.

## Frequently Asked Questions
#### How Is Vena’s Integration With Excel Different from Datarails’?
Unlike Vena, Datarails is not fully integrated with Excel, but rather works with Excel via Flex, an add-in. This lets you access your planning and analysis tools within an Excel workbook but has the limitations of any plugin—only allowing limited features, sharing and modeling capabilities. It can also introduce data management challenges. Updates made in your Datarails database—including new accounts and nomenclature changes—won't be reflected in Excel automatically, and to share templates with budget contributors you must create split Excel files for each department.

#### How Long Does It Take To Implement Vena?
The goal of any Vena implementation is to achieve value as soon as possible. But “fast” shouldn’t be your only objective—it’s more important that we build a quality foundation for your continued success. How long the implementation takes will depend on the scope of your initial project and the readiness of your team and data. With the right foundations in place, your Vena implementation can achieve value in as little as 6–8 weeks.

Datarails says their implementations take 4–6 weeks, however, customers receive less support throughout that process and are left to build reports largely on their own.

#### What Systems Does Vena Integrate With?
Vena has six pre-built connectors available through Microsoft Fabric, a unified cloud-based data management and analytics platform. These connectors are for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance & Operations, SAP S/4 HANA, Deltek Vantagepoint, Acumatica, Xero and One Lake. Vena also has pre-built connectors for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central, NetSuite, Sage Intacct and Quickbooks. Vena can connect to any system you need through bi-directional APIs, ETL and Microsoft Power Automate. Learn more about Vena’s integrations.

#### How Much Does Vena Cost?
Vena’s pricing is customized to your business’s unique needs. Datarails emphasizes its low cost due to the fact that they don’t charge implementation fees, however this approach means you don’t have the expert support needed to ensure your team is sufficiently trained on the platform to be successful. Vena’s hands-on approach to implementation leads to lower cost of ownership overall. In BARC's 2025 Planning Survey, users rated Vena 9.6 for price to value.

#### Vena or Datarails: Which Is Best for Your Team?
If you’re evaluating both Vena and Datarails for your FP&A needs, the size of your business will likely play a role in your decision. Datarails is best for early-stage companies primarily looking for a financial reporting solution. Vena, on the other hand, is best for scaling and mature businesses looking for an all-inclusive solution to support the full scope of their financial and operational planning.
