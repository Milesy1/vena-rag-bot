## How the Technology Works
Vena simplifies financial planning and analysis processes through a centralized database. Its native Excel interface (which preserves the full functionality of Excel, in contrast to the Excel plug-in approach some vendors take) allows you to work in a familiar environment while reconciling your data back to a single source of truth, providing your business with the scalability it needs to plan effectively.
The system's foundation is built on online analytical processing (OLAP) database technology, facilitating multi-dimensional analysis of large data volumes. The platform, powered by Vena’s CubeFLEX™ technology makes it easy for you to add dimensions through which to slice your data. This supports agile planning as your business grows and your operations become more complex.
As a result, Vena suits organizations of all sizes and scales as they grow. While the platform does have a learning curve, Vena's support and powerful features make it an ideal addition to a mid-sized business' FP&A team.
Cube integrates natively with both Excel and Google Sheets, giving FP&A teams flexibility in choosing their spreadsheet platform. The platform's technology—also built in OLAP like Vena—is designed to support planning, analysis and collaboration with speed and confidence, catering to the needs of high-growth companies.
However, users report that the Excel integration can be temperamental, with some saying that the add-on needs installation every few weeks. Cube's relatively recent presence in the FP&A space also presents scalability issues.
For instance, users can only model scenarios across four predefined and four custom dimensions. While these limits will work well for smaller FP&A teams, larger teams with more complex needs might find the platform limiting.
Despite these shortfalls, Cube's platform is easy to navigate and the team's continuous support and updates make it a popular choice for many early stage companies.
## Ease of Use
Vena's strong Excel integration gives it a familiar face to almost every finance professional. User reviews on G2 highlight Vena's "easy-to-use interface" and the many integrations that make the platform "more reliable and user-friendly."
On review platforms such as Capterra and G2, Vena's ease of use and user interface rank high among the pros of the platform.
User reviews routinely mention ad-hoc report creation and strong version control as particular strengths of the platform, aside from its flexibility.
Scores from 4.5/5 to 4.6/5 on G2 and Capterra respectively suggest a platform with an intuitive UI and the ability to simplify complex processes. In addition, Vena is featured in Capterra's shortlist rankings for top budgeting tools.
Cube's integration with Excel and Google Sheets often crops up in user reviews when mentioning its ease of use. Users consistently praise the platform's intuitive interface that ensures quick adoption with a minimal learning curve.
Reviewers also highlight the Dimension Manager and calculated fields when highlighting its ease of use. The platform's flexibility in handling transactional and operational data in one place is frequently mentioned as a key benefit.
While Cube generally receives positive feedback for its usability, some users note that there can be a slight learning curve for certain features. The lack of a drill down feature is another drawback. Additionally, a few reviewers mention that the Google Sheets add-in can be slow with large queries.
Despite these concerns, the overall sentiment regarding Cube's ease of use remains overwhelmingly positive, with users rating it 4.5/5 in G2 and Capterra, with users rating its ease of use at 4.8/5 on Capterra.
## AI Capabilities
Vena offers two AI-driven solutions: Vena Copilot and Vena Insights.
Vena Copilot for FP&A is a specialized GenAI tool built for FP&A teams. It leverages OpenAI's GPT-4 and Vena's CubeFLEX™ analytical data model and is pre-trained on hundreds of common FP&A questions to serve you with the most relevant results.
Using natural language processing, Copilot can perform several tasks such as data gathering, report generation, trend analysis and answering complex business questions. A key advantage of Copilot is its ease of setup, requiring no IT, data science or AI engineering expertise.
Vena Insights, on the other hand, is an intelligent reporting and analytics solution that incorporates embedded Power BI along with AI and machine learning technologies. This tool enables FP&A teams to apply predictive analytics and anomaly detection to their data, helping to identify inefficiencies, isolate key business drivers, spot trends and compare different scenarios.
By combining these AI capabilities, Vena provides a comprehensive, intelligent solution for FP&A teams at companies of all sizes.
Cube currently does not possess AI capabilities.

## Vena Reviews
"I love how easy it is to take any of my spreadsheets and integrate them into Vena. Was able to simplify a lot of spreadsheets but bringing the data in via the cloud rather than dropping it from our accounting system. [...] Largest problem we solved was our budget spreadsheet was getting too big so we broke it down and brought it into Vena and now with the audit trail we feel very confident with the integrity of it and monitoring the changes. The biggest benefits we realized was what else we could use it for. We use it for so much more than we initially intended to use it for."
"The best part about Vena is the versatility of the implementation of the solution. The software can be adapted to any type of company even to the ones with the most complex behaviours. The implementation is easy [...] but compared to other systems it has a very nice integration with your already existing excel models, so it is very user-friendly."
"The best part of Vena is that it can easily be integrated with MS Excel and even a user who doesn't have much information about Excel can work on it with huge data. The worst part is its interface which is a little different to learn initially and takes a little time."
## Cube Reviews
“Our favorite feature is also our biggest frustration. The Google Sheet add-in is extremely slow and occasionally times out with large queries. If you make a duplicate of a file, you will need to reselect your range to pull a query. It is slow and frustrating, but we are happy to have the connectivity. [...] At this time, Cube is not an ideal product for larger teams. It works for a team of 3 but we occasionally run into issues when team members have to delay their loads while we wait for another to complete. I'm sure that this issue would only compound with added team members.”
“Cube is very flexible and is easy to layer onto existing workflows in excel and google sheets. It is a fairly lightweight solution that makes reporting and analysis a lot easier. As a growing product, Cube still has a little ways to go with functionality, specifically around headcount/staffing planning and data import functionality. That being said, as a lightweight tool I appreciate that they have not overloaded with unnecessary features - the core product works well.”
"Really happy with the overall flexibility of the system and the ability to have transactional and operational data all in one place! As it is based in Excel, it is easy to look at things in different ways and to quickly analyze data or change the drivers of your forecast. [...] Had to rebuild all forecast models in excel in a way that was compatible to load the data into Cube, which was more time consuming than anticipated. Additionally, formatting of reports does not save in Cube, so every time you go to fetch/build something from the system, you have to re-format or manually add new account to an existing report in excel. Gets tricky when business is constantly evolving/changing.”
## Vena vs. Cube: Which Is Best for Your Team?
Both Vena and Cube are tailored solutions for your FP&A team, but each platform has its strengths that may make it more suitable for different types of organizations.
Vena's ample features make it ideal for small, mid-sized and mature businesses looking to scale their FP&A functions efficiently and build for the future. In contrast, Cube is better suited to lean finance teams taking their first steps in FP&A.
Vena shines with its native Excel integration, providing a familiar interface for finance teams. Vena's AI capabilities, including Vena Copilot and Vena Insights, provide advanced analytics and automation features that can streamline complex FP&A processes and create much needed scale for busy teams.
Vena's tiered pricing allows for scalability and the platform's comprehensive feature set, including workforce planning and financial close management, makes it well-suited for small, mid-size and mature companies looking for an all-inclusive FP&A solution that can grow with their needs.
Cube's Excel-based interface and Google Sheets integration provide flexibility for teams using different spreadsheet platforms. This could be particularly advantageous for organizations heavily invested in the Google ecosystem.
When it comes to customer support, Vena offers a more structured approach with Standard and Premium support plans, as well as the Vena Academy for ongoing learning. Cube's support structure is less clear, even if it is robust according to reviews.
Consider factors such as your team's size, the complexity of your financial processes, your preferred spreadsheet platform and your long-term FP&A goals when comparing Vena versus Cube.
