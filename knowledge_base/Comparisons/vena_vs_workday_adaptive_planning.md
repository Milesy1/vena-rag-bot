# Vena vs. Workday Adaptive Planning: Comparing Features, Integrations, Reviews and More
FP&A managers, and even CFOs, are up to their elbows in evaluations—all day, every day, in many cases. To free up resources, many finance leaders are investing heavily in bringing in new technologies like corporate performance management (CPM) platforms, which may also help lower costs. Almost 60% of CFOs note that strategic cost reduction is at the top of their agenda, according to recent survey data from PwC.
Choosing the most robust and dynamic CPM tool has its own challenges, of course. Evaluating any B2B software, and especially one designed for finance teams, is often a complex process. Each platform has its own unique strengths, meaning some platforms may be better suited to certain companies or industries over others.
Two options that FP&A leaders may find themselves considering are Vena and Workday Adaptive Planning. Given the multitude of features, variables, integrations and more, trying to get a handle on how Vena and Adaptive Planning stack up can be a challenge.
We’re making it easier on you by giving you a deep dive comparing the two options.

## How the Technology Works
Vena offers FP&A leaders a single unified platform for many use cases, all built around a native Excel interface and native integration into Microsoft 365 applications. Vena’s hybrid online analytical processing (OLAP) database technology, Vena CubeFLEXTM, and relational database enables multidimensional analysis of large volumes of business data. That means users have more dynamic, all-encompassing viewpoints of their data.
Vena easily combines various data sources, unifying them for categorization and analysis. That is beneficial in CPM because it lets you find the data you need from across your data sources to model various scenarios, create budgets, make forecasts, build reports and more. It also requires less manual maintenance, with no admin necessary to create an intersection of data before it becomes viewable.
Vena’s native integration with Excel also means your established workflow doesn’t need to change much, if at all. Creating a low friction change management environment makes the planning and reporting process accessible to everyone.
### Adaptive Planning
Workday’s philosophy behind Adaptive Planning is to create a large-scale, holistic view of a customer’s business, and allow the platform to flex, scale and remain easy to use. With that in mind, the platform is powered by what Adaptive calls Elastic Hypercube Technology (EHT), which is an in-memory modeling engine that works with its integration framework.
This allows the platform to add or subtract memory and computing power when needed, creating a dynamic sense of scaling and modeling.
It’s important to note that Workday Adaptive Planning’s interface uses its own proprietary formula logic, not those of Microsoft Excel. Vena, on the other hand, embraces Excel’s existing logic, making for a potentially smoother transition for users.
## Ease of Use
Vena’s roots are in Excel, which means there’s generally a short learning curve for many FP&A users. Some of the numerous templates and reports can be used out of the box. These templates were created with industry best practices in mind, helping users get started without much additional effort.
“For the past 4+ years, I have been using Vena and I can truly admit that it's one of the best and easiest finance and accounts management tools. It is very easy and simple to create sales reports and accounts on Vena and the availability of a customer support team is an added advantage. I like its intuitive and user-friendly interface which makes it super easy to learn and understand,” writes one G2 reviewer.
Furthermore, Vena has earned 4.5/5 stars for “ease-of-use” on Software Advice and Capterra.
### Adaptive Planning
As noted, Adaptive Planning was built with ease of use in mind. The platform creates and links its plans to a larger, corporate plan overseen by finance teams—that way, there’s a single, unified system for strategic decision-making.
“The user-friendly interface, customization, regular updates and wealth of support and information. Reporting is also easy to use and very powerful. One of our main challenges is accurately planning and reporting our allocations. AI makes it easy,” writes a reviewer on Software Advice.
Adaptive Planning earned 4.2/5 stars for “ease of use” on Capterra and 4.2/5 on Software Advice.
## AI Capabilities
Vena offers two AI-powered tools: Vena Copilot and Vena Insights, both embedded into the Vena Complete Planning Platform.
#### Vena Copilot
#### Vena Insights
Vena’s other AI tool, Vena Insights, is an intelligent reporting and analytics solution that incorporates AI and machine learning technology through embedded Power BI to empower finance teams with faster insights. It offers tools such as predictive analytics and anomaly detection that can find inefficiencies, isolate key business drivers and more.
### Workday Adaptive Planning
Workday says that it takes a “unique approach” to both AI and machine learning tools, and as such, embeds them both “into the very core” of their platforms. As it relates to Workday Adaptive Planning, the AI and machine learning components help with developing forecasts and plans—which should get more accurate as time goes on—as well as reporting real-time insights from your data, which can pinpoint anomalies.
Additionally, users can navigate the platform with conversational text, allowing AI to facilitate requests.

## Vena Reviews
“We deployed Vena in 2020 as an ERP extension to our legacy system. Vena empowered sales metrics on the front end, financial project management in the middle and financial reporting at the job level on the back end. We deployed a second "cube" data warehouse after the initial launch for financial reporting. Each deployment has worked as prescribed and brought extraordinary value to our construction company.”
“After using the Vena now I can say it's the best accounting software where we can reconcile ending balances. Now we can easily identify discrepancies or time differences between the bank statement and financial records. With a centralized database, we can easily collect all the data from different departments and generate a collective report about company progress. That's why I totally recommended this software to all my corporate friends.”
“What I like best about Vena is its very seamless Excel integration, which allows me and my team to work in a familiar environment while leveraging Vena's powerful automation functions. We now also can automate manual processes like budgeting, consolidation of data and reporting, which saves me valuable time and also reduces the risk of errors. Additionally, Vena fosters collaboration across teams, helping multiple members work together on financial planning in real-time, enhancing overall efficiency.”
## Adaptive Planning Reviews
“One of its standout aspects is its flexibility. It allows organizations to create customized financial models and forecasts that can adapt to their unique needs. Its user-friendly interface and powerful integration capabilities also make it easier for teams to collaborate and make data-driven decisions. The ability to perform real-time analysis and scenario planning is another strong point, helping businesses stay agile and responsive to changing conditions.”
“Incredibly user-friendly! I have had people who are not particularly technologically-savvy (outside of Finance) use it to review expenses, and they have picked it up quickly. The OfficeConnect plugin makes monthly reporting very easy, as well as updating forecasts on a regular basis.”
“It helped us to give real time reports to management that helped them to get financial planning solutions. Very easy to use reporting and real-time consolidation that helps planning ahead. Mostly used for reporting to high management, and each time it provided fast and amazing solutions. Has lots of features. Limited customisation and overall pricing could be the only con but works really well with large companies.”
## Overall Vena vs. Adaptive Planning Review: Which Is Best for Your Team?
A review of the main features, use-cases and customer feedback for both Vena and Workday Adaptive Planning reveals that the two platforms may both be viable choices for finance teams and CFOs.
The fact is, either platform will likely do most of what a finance team needs, but there are some stark differences between them, and those differences may end up being the most important factors when deciding which platform to adopt.
Notably, Vena’s platform, with its native Excel integration, may put it over the top for some finance teams, particularly those that want to continue to work on Excel and leverage everything they may have built for reporting and planning. That integration means that there are no new formulas to learn. Plus, onboarding users has a plug-and-play dynamic because there are no languages or IT scripting to master.
While Adaptive has its strengths, many users report it has a considerable learning curve, with a new formula and business logic syntax that users need to learn.
Another thing to consider is that Vena is designed to be maintained self-sufficiently by finance teams. With Adaptive Planning, a consultant may be needed to help facilitate integrations or integrate new formulas. A finance team may never feel like they fully “own” the platform, which has been the case in some instances.
“We used Adaptive Insights for budgeting. We bought the tool for four years and never used it because we couldn’t make it work,” said Christine Harms, former Controller for the Arizona Cardinals.
It’s also important to consider your company’s size and resources. Adaptive Planning is part of the broader suite of tools that Workday offers. Many of those tools are powerful and useful, Adaptive Planning included. But they can also take some time to get used to. There may be some integration work to do as well to ensure all systems are running smoothly.
Given that, Adaptive Planning may be a good choice if you’re running a larger company that may need access to the broader range of tools and platforms offered by Workday. All things considered, large, mid-size and small companies alike that value nimbleness, flexibility, simplicity and ease of use, may find Vena a better fit. It also comes recommended by many existing users across a variety of criteria.
