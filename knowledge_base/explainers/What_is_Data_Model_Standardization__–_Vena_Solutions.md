Explainer: What is Data Model
Standardization?
Data Model S tandar dization  consists of components that standardize and apply
context to data models to help scale solutions without compromising flexibility.
 
What is Data Model Standardization?
Instead of a one-size-fits-all S tandard Model with restrictions on the number of dimensions
supported, V ena now offers standard components (via  Dimension T ypes and S tandard Members )
that can be applied to any data model.

Why should I adopt Data Model Standardization?
With DMS, any data model can use Dimension T ypes and S tandard Members, which are a V ena-
standard definition of dimensions and members. This V ena-standard dimension allows V ena to
understand any dimension or member, regardless of what you name it within your environment.
Dimension T ypes and S tandard Members give context to what a dimension or member is used for
and allow V ena to understand data models better to build smarter features for you.

Assigning Dimension T ypes and S tandard Members to dimensions in your existing data models
allows you to apply standardization practices to any model. By assigning Dimension T ypes and
Standard Members, you can leverage product features that rely on them, such as FX Functions,
Vena Insights, and more. Find out how to assign  Dimension T ypes and S tandard Members . 
 
What happened to Standard Models?
As of F all 2023, V ena is moving away from S tandard and non-standard models. Instead, with Data
Model S tandarization, now any model can adopt standard practices with  Dimension T ypes and
Standard Members . Data models that were formerly called “S tandard Models” will no longer have
the S tandard Model label. However, you can continue using them like any other data model. 26/12/2025, 15:41 Explainer: What is Data Model Standardization? – Vena Solutions
