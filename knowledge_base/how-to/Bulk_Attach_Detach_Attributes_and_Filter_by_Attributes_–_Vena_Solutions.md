How-To: Bulk Attach/Detach
Attributes and Filter by Attributes
Maintaining your attributes is easier than ever with new features like bulk attach
attributes and filter by attribute.
 
Why use this feature?
With V ena’s new attribute maintenance functionality, we’ve introduced two new features to
enhance how you work with attributes.  Bulk  attribute attach and detach  lets you add or remove
multiple attributes to a dimension member with a few easy clicks. With  filter by
attribute,  searching through your attributes is easier than before. Y ou can quickly filter through a
dimension hierarchy by a specific attribute and view all members currently attached to that
attribute. 
 
In this article, you’ll learn about attribute maintenance, how to bulk attach and detach attributes
and how to filter a hierarchy by a specific attribute.
 
Before you begin
To follow the instructions in this article, you will need  Modeler  access.  If you’re unfamiliar with how
to create an attribute, please check out this article.
