Shar ed member s and alt ernate hierar chies
You may want to recall a roll-up that includes/excludes members from the main hierarchy. Y oucan
do this by sharing members to another parent and mapping the new alternative parent to the
template later on. T o share a member, perform the following steps:
1. Right-click anywhere on a member row or use the  vertical ellipses (3 dots)  to open the
dialogue box. 
2. Select the  Shar e Member  option.
3. Select the parent member you would like to share under and select  Complet e Shar e to share
the member. 26/12/2025, 15:45 How-To: Build and Manage Data Models in Modeler – Vena Solutions

4. The member will now also appear under the parent member selected. There will be a shared
icon beside the shared member name. Deleting one position will not delete the others.

cluttering the hierarchy is to use a calculated member.

Member  from the drop-down menu. 26/12/2025, 15:45 How-To: Build and Manage Data Models in Modeler – Vena Solutions

expressions.
