Why use this feature?
Assign Dimension T ypes and S tandard Members in your data models to add context and more
efficiently leverage exciting new features. By implementing Dimension T ypes and S tandard Members,
you can unlock further capabilities such as FX Functions, Insights, T emplate S tudio, V ena Copilot and
more.  
  
Dimension T ypes and S tandard Members integrate a V ena standard definition for members and
dimensions in your data model. For example, you might name your Net Income member  NI,
Revenue member  Sales  or Account dimension  GL Ac counts . We continue to offer this flexibility in
naming conventions and now, with this additional layer of standardization in our product, we can
offer exciting new features at scale with minimal model configuration from customers. 
  
Using Dimension T ypes and S tandard Members ensures that regardless of whether your Income
Statement member is called “Income S tatement” or “IS” if assigned the S tandard Member Income
Statement, V ena understands the purpose of that member and can seamlessly integrate your data
model when expanding your solution to V ena Insights, FX Functions etc.

Notes & limitations
There are 14 Dimension T ypes that you can use: Account, Entity, Department, Y ear, P eriod,
Scenario, Measure, Currency, Custom, Geography, Project, Customer, Product and V endor.  More
Dimension T ypes are expected to be added in the future to support expanding use cases.
Custom is the only Dimension T ype that can be tagged more than once in the same model.
When creating new models from scratch, you can now add new dimensions with pre-defined
Dimension T ypes from the dropdown list in addition to the standard custom dimensions. 
Dimension T ypes are retained in every model where a dimension is linked.    
Dimension T ypes must be assigned before assigning S tandard Members.  
You are not required to assign all S tandard Members – we highly encourage customers to assign
as many as are relevant or in use in your data models.
A member from your hierarchy can only be assigned to one S tandard Member.  
Expression Σ (or Calculated) members cannot be assigned to a S tandard Member.  
If a Dimension T ype is unassigned or if a dimension is deleted that had S tandard Members
assigned, those S tandard Members will also be deleted.
