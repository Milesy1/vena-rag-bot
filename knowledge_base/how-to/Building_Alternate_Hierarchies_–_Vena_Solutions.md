How-To: Building Alternate
Hierarchies
Create custom roll-ups using  Alternate Hierar chies  for efficient report creation.
 
Why use this featur e?
An alternate hierarchy allows you to create alternate groupings of members from an existing data
model to simplify mapping and allow for automatic updates to the data from your source system.
In an alternate hierarchy, the same members can be repeated in both hierarchies, but the way in
which you order or roll up your members can be revised via your alternate hierarchy. For example, if
you need a breakdown by a particular set (e.g., projects in a particular month), you can create an
alternate hierarchy to list the projects in the order of the month that they start. 
 
(If you’re unsure whether to use an alternate hierarchy or a calculated member to meet your project
needs,  learn mor e her e.)

In order to complete the steps outlined on this page, you will need at least  Modeler  access and the
appropriate Application P ermissions for the model you are updating.
If Data P ermissions are set up in your environment, you will also need the appropriate permissions
for the data that you are working with.
 
How t o
Create an alt ernate hierar chy
To create an alternate hierarchy, you will need to add additional sibling and child members to your
existing hierarchy of choice. In the example, below, we will be adding an alternate hierarchy to a
data model used for tracking projects.
 
Create new P arents, Siblings, and Childr en
1. Log into vena.io and navigate to the  Modeler  tab. 
2. Locate the data model where you want to create the alternate hierarchy and find the relevant
member.
3. Right-click the  Parent member  and select  Add Sibling  from the drop-down menu. 
4. Enter the name of your new member. 26/12/2025, 15:45 How-To: Building Alternate Hierarchies – Vena Solutions

5. Select   +Add Member .
6. Depending on how you want to organize your hierarchy, you can continue to add Siblings.
7. Once you’ve created your Siblings, right-click the sibling member you just created and
select  Add Child . 
8.  Name your new member and select  +Add Member .
9. Continue until you’ve finished adding all your child members. Once you’ve added your children,
the next step is to share your members to the alternate hierarchy.
