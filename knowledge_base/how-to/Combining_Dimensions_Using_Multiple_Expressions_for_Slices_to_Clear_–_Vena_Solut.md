How to
1. Navigate to the  Modeler  tab.
2. Select  Data T ransfor mations .
3. In Channels, select the appropriate  Destination .
4. Use a comma to separate your MQL query into separate expressions. This will allow you to
combine dimensions to form a more specific slice of data.
5. Consider the example below. Here the MQL is split into two expressions by the comma. The first
part before the comma defines P eriod 3 of the year 2023. The second part defines the entire year
of 2024. In this example, the two expressions are combined so that the slices to clear are defined
