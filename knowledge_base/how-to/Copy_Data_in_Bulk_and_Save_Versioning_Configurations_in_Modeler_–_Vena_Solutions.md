How-To: Copy Data in Bulk and Save
Versioning Configurations in
Modeler
Bulk-copy data with the  Versioning  tool to quickly create new budgets or scenarios
from your existing data.
 
Why use this feature?
Versioning  is a flexible tool that lets you copy data from one part of your data model to another.
It's especially useful for creating budgets--For example, by copying last year’s actuals or budgets
into the upcoming year’s budget to establish a baseline for contributors.
While budgeting is the most common use case, V ersioning’s ability to copy large volumes of
intersection data also supports other scenarios, such as:
Modeling What-If scenarios by duplicating budget versions from a single template.
Clearing data by copying blank values into target intersections using the Clear Destination
Values option.
In this article, you’ll learn how to:
Use V ersioning for basic data copying tasks.
Leverage advanced options for more complex scenarios.
Remove data from intersections using V ersioning.
 
Before you begin
To complete the steps outlined in this article, you will need at least  Modeler  access. If Data
Permissions are set up in your environment, you will also need the appropriate permissions for the
data that you are working with.
